Short Story Assignment
Assignment Description
Before beginning the assignment, please ensure you fill in your project and short story assignment details in the spreadsheet.

In this assignment, you are required to conduct a thorough review and analysis of a topic within the realm of Large Language Models or Foundation Models. This involves selecting a specific area of focus, such as tabular, graph, or time-series foundation models. Your primary objective is to explore this area in depth, providing a comprehensive understanding of the current advancements and insights in the field. The basis of your review should be scholarly papers written in the second half of 2023 or in 2024, with a preference for survey papers or those accepted at significant conferences like NIPS 2023, ICML 2024, or ICLR 2024. It is crucial that your work is original and authentic, avoiding any form of plagiarism or auto-generation, as it will be verified using tools like TurnItIn.

Expected Assignment Deliverables
