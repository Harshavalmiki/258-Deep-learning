Assignment-5

Guidelines
You must create a 3-layer neural network.You must use einsum.
Use a non-linear 3-dimensional equation.
Generate syntetic data using the equation you used and plot using 4-d plot in matplotlib.
After completing the colabs, you will need to upload a video showing the code checked into GitHub as well as a code walkthrough of the main sections and any final output that is generated.


Assignment Description

Numpy
PyTorch without built-in layer functionality
