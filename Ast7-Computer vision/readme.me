 Assignment- Computer Vision
Description
Part A- Supervised Contrastive Learning
Write a colab to demonstrate supervised contrastive learning loss based supervised classification versus regular softmax based one. Please provide necessary visualizations.

Hint: See section labeled Part 1 References.

Part B Description - Transfer Learning on Various Modalities
Write simple colabs to transfer learn on images, videos, audios - with both as a feature extractor as well as a fine tuning usecases.

Image: Showcase basic transfer learning for a classification task (either cats/dogs or breeds of dogs) in a colab - with both as a feature extractor as well as a fine tuning usecase

Hint: See section labeled Part 2 References.

Part C Description - Zero-Shot Transfer Learning
Write a colab showcasing the following:

zero-shot transfer learning using the CLIP model
transfer learning using state of art models from tfhub (Eg: use bigtransfer for example)
Hint: See section labeled Part 3 References.
